# Genomic heterogeneity inflates the performance of variant pathogenicity predictions

This repository contains all the codes to replicate the benchmark generation, the scores of protein sequence and DNA sequence mutations. <br>
We categorize the model into 2 directories: <br>
DNA models: AlphaGenome, DNABERT2, Evo2, GPNMSA, NT, PhyloGPN, PhyloP. <br>
Protein models: ESM Models, AlphaMissense, PrimateAI3D. <br>
